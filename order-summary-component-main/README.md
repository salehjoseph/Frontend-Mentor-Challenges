### What I learned

This project helped me reinforce my knowledge of responsive design, CSS custom properties, and accessibility principles. Below is an example of code I implemented:

```html
<div class="card">
  <h1>Order Summary</h1>
  <p>Review your order before proceeding to checkout.</p>
</div>
.card {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  border-radius: 10px;
  padding: 1.5rem;
}
```
### Continued Development

I aim to further improve my understanding of advanced CSS concepts like CSS Grid and animations. I also plan to enhance my JavaScript skills for more interactive components.
