## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project reinforced the importance of structuring HTML for accessibility and using CSS custom properties for consistency. I also gained experience in creating hover states for interactive elements.

Here is an example of a hover effect I implemented:

```css
.card:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

```
### Continued development

I aim to further refine my skills in creating responsive designs and explore more advanced CSS techniques, including animations and transitions.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Comprehensive documentation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - An excellent platform for practicing frontend development challenges.
