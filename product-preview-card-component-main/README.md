## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this challenge, I improved my understanding of responsive design and learned how to structure CSS properties effectively. Below is an example of the CSS I used for a hover state:

```css
.button:hover {
  background-color: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
  color: white;
}
```
### Continued development

I aim to further refine my skills in creating responsive designs and explore more advanced CSS techniques, including animations and transitions.

### Useful resources
