## My Process  

### Built With  
- Semantic HTML5  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- Responsive Design (Media Queries)  
- [Frontend Mentor Starter Code](https://www.frontendmentor.io)  

### What I Learned  
This project helped me:  
- Understand the importance of **semantic HTML elements** like `<main>` and `<section>` for accessibility and SEO.  
- Improve my skills in crafting responsive layouts using **media queries** and flexbox.  
- Enhance my ability to replicate a design as closely as possible from a given static image.  

Key Code Snippets:  
```css
/* Example of responsive design */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```
## Continued Development  
I aim to further refine my responsiveness skills, improve on accessibility, and explore more advanced layout techniques like CSS Grid.
